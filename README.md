Image Gallery is a modern, responsive web-based image management system built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a vibrant dark-themed UI with nine image categories displayed in a clean 3x3 grid layout. Users can explore each folder to view images and perform actions such as marking favorites (❤️), hiding images (🔒), or deleting them (🗑️). Hidden images are moved to a password-protected section and can be restored to their original folders. Deleted images appear in the "Recently Deleted" section for recovery. The app also includes a full-image preview with interactive action icons and updates all views in real-time without reloading the page. The interface is fully responsive and optimized for desktop and mobile devices, offering a smooth and intuitive image browsing experience.
